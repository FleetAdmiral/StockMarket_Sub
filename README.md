As informed over mail, the repository contains two approaches to the same problem: One that focuses on keeping parameters and data the same while experimenting with multiple different models (Breadth) and another one that fixes a model (MLP) and then focuses on feature tuning and hyperparamter optimisation to get as low of a MSE valuse as possible with said given module (Depth).

Both folders contain their respective README that explains the goal and implementation of that method and also gives instructions on how to execute the given depth/breadth model.
